# fdd3000_cpm
CP/M system for Timex FDD3000

The source was restored / recreated from old manuals, sources from internet and files distributed with FDD3000 station.
You can compile it with pasmo or sjasm, but only sjasm allows to create final binary in one pass (it can compile sources
with overlapping areas of code)
